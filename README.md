A couple differences between how the page rendered in Lab 4 vs. Lab 6 are content delivery and loading speed. In Lab 6's page, there is a server running the page dynamically, which means the page can change based on different requests. However, in Lab 4's page, the content is static, meaning it is the same throughout all instances for any user accessing the page. Because of this, Lab 4's page probably runs faster since it holds the same content regardless of the requests.
